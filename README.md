## 🛠️ About Zappmint

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-zappmint.netlify.app-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://zappmint.netlify.app/)

**Zappmint** is a **vibe coding platform** that transforms prompts into functional mini-apps—called **Zapps**—instantly. It’s built for creators, hackers, and anyone who wants to ship fun, experimental apps with zero code.

But Zappmint isn’t just about building—it’s about owning.

Each Zapp you create is **minted as a Zora Coin**—a unique ERC-20 token using the [Zora Coins SDK](https://docs.zora.co/coins). These **AppCoins** power access, funding, and monetization from the moment your app goes live.

### 💡 Why Zappmint?

While other no-code tools help you build, **Zappmint helps you build and own**. AppCoins (minted as Zora Coins) create sustainable, community-powered micro-app ecosystems where:

- Users fund what they want to see
- Creators earn from what they build
- Apps grow through network effects and onchain incentives

### 🔗 Powered by Zora Coins

We use the [Zora Coins SDK](https://docs.zora.co/coins/sdk) to mint ERC-20 tokens on Zora for each app. This enables seamless, cost-effective token creation that feels native to the Zapp creation flow.
